If you just want a one-off Docker image, use `cr_deploy_docker()` or make your own build via `cr_buildstep_docker()`

If you want the Docker image to rebuild each git commit, then you also need a build trigger.  This can be enabled using `cr_deploy_docker_trigger()`

The below example builds this package's Dockerfile upon each commit, for a Dockerfile located in the `cloud_build/` folder.

```r
repo <- cr_buildtrigger_repo("MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner")
cr_deploy_docker_trigger(repo, "test3", dir = "cloud_build")
```

### Kaniko cache

A common workflow is to make lots of repeat builds of Docker images as you update the files and libraries within the Dockerfile.  If this is a heavy operation it can take 20mins+ to build the image.

If it is a long build, consider using the [kaniko cache](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/kaniko-cache) option in your Docker builds.  This caches each step of the Dockerfile so only those that are new are built, and can considerably speed up Docker build times. 

To use, select the `kamiko_cache=TRUE` option in your builds:

```r
cr_deploy_docker("my_folder", kaniko_cache=TRUE)
```
