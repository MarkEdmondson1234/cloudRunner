title: "Examples using googleCloudRunner for serverless R"
---

Here will be some example use cases you can use googleCloudRunner for.

Since almost any code can be called and passed via Docker images, there is a lot of potential uses.

* Scheduling R scripts in the cloud
* R APIs to call from anywhere
* Triggering R code to run on events, such as BigQuery table updates or GitHub pushes
* Checking a package, creating a website, deploying it to GitHub
* Running authenticated tests for R packages in private environment
* Creating an Rmarkdown powered website using Cloud Run
* Integrating R with other language applications
* Public and private Docker image creations on triggers

## Connecting to GitHub 

Connect via the [Source Repository mirroring service](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs/mirroring-a-github-repository).

Once your repo is connected, you can operate on R packages on GitHub via:

```r
# this repo mirrored on Google Source repos
my_repo <- Source(
  repoSource=RepoSource("github_markedmondson1234_googlecloudrunner",
                        branchName="master"))
```

You can create a GitHub build trigger using `GitHubEventsConfig()` - this will by default trigger builds when you push to any GitHub branch.  

```r
cloudbuild <- system.file("cloudbuild/cloudbuild.yaml",
                           package = "googleCloudRunner")
bb <- cr_build_make(cloudbuild, projectId = "test-project")
github <- GitHubEventsConfig("MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner", branch = "master")

cr_buildtrigger("trig1", trigger = github, build = bb)
```


## Create Docker image of a package

This is what is used to deploy this package as a Docker image to the public `googleComputeEngineR` docker image project, `gcr.io/gcer-public`

This builds a Docker image of the Dockerfile in the root directory of the GitHub repo, which is then [mirrored to Google Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs/mirroring-a-github-repository) via the GitHub app. 

```r
my_image <- "gcr.io/my-project/my-image"

# this repo mirrored on Google Source repos
my_repo <- RepoSource("MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner",
                      branchName="master"))
                        
docker_yaml <- cr_build_yaml(steps = cr_buildstep_docker(my_image))

built_docker <- cr_build(docker_yaml, source = my_repo)

# make a build trigger so it builds on each push to master
cr_buildtrigger("build-docker", trigger = my_repo, build = built_docker)
```

## Trigger an R function from pubsub

This uses `cr_deploy_run` to deploy an R API that can then be triggered from pub/sub events, such as Cloud logging events or when files get updated in a Cloud Storage bucket.  This in turn can trigger other Cloud Builds. 

A plumber API that accepts pub/sub messages is facilitated by `cr_plumber_pubsub()`

`api.R`:

```r
# example function echos back pubsub message
# change to do something more interesting with event data
pub <- function(x){
  paste("Echo:", x)
}

#' Recieve pub/sub message
#' @post /pubsub
#' @param message a pub/sub message
function(message=NULL){
  googleCloudRunner::cr_plumber_pubsub(message, pub)
}
```

Deploy the R API using an image that has plumber and googleCloudRunner installed.  There is one available at `gcr.io/gcer-public/googlecloudrunner`

`Dockerfile`:

```
FROM gcr.io/gcer-public/googlecloudrunner:master

COPY [".", "./"]

ENTRYPOINT ["R", "-e", "pr <- plumber::plumb(commandArgs()[4]); pr$run(host='0.0.0.0', port=as.numeric(Sys.getenv('PORT')))"]
CMD ["api.R"]
```

Put both the Dockerfile and the `api.R` script in the same folder then deploy it to Cloud Run:

```r
cr_deploy_run("the_folder")
```

Once built you will have a pub/sub live that will trigger the function you defined.  You can test pubsub messages via `cr_pubsub()`

```r
test_url <- "http://your-cloudrun-api.com/pubsub"

cr_pubsub(test_url, "hello")
# [1] "Echo: hello"
```

In this case the function only echos, but you can modify the function to call other libraries, functions, operate on data sent in pubsub such as bucket object names, BigQuery tableIds, etc.

```r
# perhaps the function calls another Cloud Build
pub <- function(x){
  cr_build(x, source = my_source)
}
```
