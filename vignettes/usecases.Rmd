Here will be some example use cases you can use googleCloudRunner for.

Since almost any code can be called and passed via Docker images, there are a lot of potential uses.

* Scheduling R scripts in the cloud
* R APIs to call from anywhere
* Triggering R code to run on events, such as BigQuery table updates or GitHub pushes
* Checking a package, creating a website, deploying it to GitHub
* Running authenticated tests for R packages in private environment
* Creating an Rmarkdown powered website using Cloud Run
* Integrating R with other language applications
* Public and private Docker image creations on triggers

Some [community contributed Cloud Build images are listed here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community), including [hugo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/hugo), [make](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/make), and [tar](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/tar).

## Create Docker image of a package each commit

If you just want a one-off Docker image, use `cr_deploy_docker()` or make your own build via `cr_buildstep_docker()`

If you want the Docker image to rebuild each git commit, this is what is used to deploy this package to `gcr.io/gcer-public/googlecloudrunner` - in this case the Dockerfile in the root of the repo is built.  Simply place the Dockerfile in the root of your repo, and then create a Build Trigger with similar settings:

## Trigger an R function from pubsub

This uses `cr_deploy_plumber` to deploy an R API that can then be triggered from pub/sub events, such as Cloud logging events or when files get updated in a Cloud Storage bucket.  This in turn can trigger other Cloud Builds. 

A plumber API that accepts pub/sub messages is facilitated by `cr_plumber_pubsub()`

`api.R`:

```r
# example function echos back pubsub message
# change to do something more interesting with event data
pub <- function(x){
  paste("Echo:", x)
}

#' Recieve pub/sub message
#' @post /pubsub
#' @param message a pub/sub message
function(message=NULL){
  googleCloudRunner::cr_plumber_pubsub(message, pub)
}
```

Deploy the R API using an image that has plumber and googleCloudRunner installed.  There is one available at `gcr.io/gcer-public/googlecloudrunner`

`Dockerfile`:

```
FROM gcr.io/gcer-public/googlecloudrunner:master

COPY [".", "./"]

ENTRYPOINT ["R", "-e", "pr <- plumber::plumb(commandArgs()[4]); pr$run(host='0.0.0.0', port=as.numeric(Sys.getenv('PORT')))"]
CMD ["api.R"]
```

Put both the Dockerfile and the `api.R` script in the same folder then deploy it to Cloud Run:

```r
cr_deploy_plumber("the_folder")
```

Once built you will have a pub/sub live that will trigger the function you defined.  You can test pubsub messages via `cr_pubsub()`

```r
test_url <- "http://your-cloudrun-api.com/pubsub"

cr_pubsub(test_url, "hello")
# [1] "Echo: hello"
```

In this case the function only echos, but you can modify the function to call other libraries, functions, operate on data sent in pubsub such as bucket object names, BigQuery tableIds, etc.

```r
# perhaps the function calls another Cloud Build
pub <- function(x){
  cr_build(x, source = my_source)
}
```

## Build an Rmd each git commit and host its HTML on Cloud Storage

Cloud Storage can host public HTML files like a website, which can be accessed via public or private viewers.  This can be useful in setting up reporting infrastructure.

The Cloud Build below makes use of Cloud Build artifacts to send the built Rmd files to a public Cloud Storage bucket.  When an Rmd file is committed to git, this is rebuilt.

```r
r <- "rmarkdown::render('scheduled_rmarkdown.Rmd', output_file = 'scheduled_rmarkdown.html')"

rmd_build <- cr_build_yaml(
  steps = cr_buildstep_r(
      id="render rmd",
      r = r,
      name = "gcr.io/gcer-public/render_rmd:master",
      dir = "inst/scheduled_rmarkdown/"
    ),
  artifacts = cr_build_yaml_artifact(
                 "inst/scheduled_rmarkdown/scheduled_rmarkdown.html", 
                 bucket = "mark-edmondson-public-read")
  )

# write out build to submit with repo
cr_build_write(rmd_build, file = "inst/cloudbuild/cloudbuild_rmd.yml")
```

The Rmd will build upon each commit, adapting to changes in the Rmd file.

The example Rmd file is build and available on a public Cloud Storage bucket - the above example is available at this [link](https://storage.googleapis.com/mark-edmondson-public-read/scheduled_rmarkdown.html)

![](schedule_markdown_hosted_gcs.png)

The two buildtriggers then build the Dockerfile to render the image (with all the necessary R libraries installed) and a build trigger to run the actual build upon each commit

![](render_rmd_buildtriggers.png)

An example of the rendering Rmd build trigger in the web UI is below:

## Build and deploy Rmd files to Cloud Run on a schedule

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have a flexdashboard that shows data from a Google Sheet with ggplotly. What&#39;s the best way to host the dashboard somewhere *and* make it so it shows the latest data? i.e. how should I show dynamic data in an RMarkdown dashboard? Continually reknit?

Cloud Run scales from 0 to millions of hits, so can be an option for hosting a website.  In particular you may want a private internal website, have R code executing via a plumber API in the same container, or have lots of traffic or data that goes over other free hosting options such as GitHub pages. A nginx server configuration is included to host any HTML you provide via `cr_deploy_html()`.  

You may prefer using Cloud Storage public URLs if you don't need any of Cloud Run's features, like the previous example. 

Coupled to that, a common use case is to render Rmd files and host them on a website like the tweet above.  For the above tweet scenario, the Rmd has a setup block that reads from googlesheets via the code below:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
library(googlesheets4)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)

# for public Googlesheets.  
# If private see https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html
sheets_deauth()

# this is the data that may update each time the Rmd is rendered
gm <- sheets_example("gap") %>% read_sheet()

gm_agg <- gm %>%
  mutate(gdp=gdpPercap*pop) %>%
  filter(continent=="Africa") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean(lifeExp), mean(gdp))

p <- ggplot(gm, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) + theme_minimal() + scale_x_log10()
```
````

The build Rmd docker in this case needs all the libraries listed (flexdashboard, googlesheets4 etc.) included in its build - this could be built before hand in another Cloud Build - in this case the libraries are all in `gcr.io/gcer-public/render_rmd`

For this example, the build is not reading from a git repo but the Rmd file is downloaded from a Cloud Storage bucket, that you may have uploaded to manually, via `googleCloudStorageR` or perhaps copied over from a repo in another Cloud Build on a Build Trigger.

The scheduled build then can be enabled via:

1. Uploading your Rmarkdown files to a Cloud Storage bucket
2. Create a build that will:
  - download the Rmd file
  - render the Rmd creating the HTML files
  - configure nginx for Cloud Run, 
  - build a Docker image of nginx with your HTML
  - serve it on Cloud Run.

```r
r <- "rmarkdown::render('scheduled_rmarkdown.Rmd', output_file = 'scheduled_rmarkdown.html')"

build_rmd <- cr_build_yaml(
      steps = c(
        cr_buildstep(
          id = "download Rmd template",
          name = "gsutil",
          args = c("cp",
                   "gs://mark-edmondson-public-read/scheduled_rmarkdown.Rmd",
                   "scheduled_rmarkdown.Rmd"),
        ),
        cr_buildstep_r(
          id="render rmd",
          r = r,
          name = "gcr.io/gcer-public/render_rmd:master"
        ),
        cr_buildstep_nginx_setup("/workspace/"),
        cr_buildstep_docker("html-on-cloudrun", tag = "$BUILD_ID"),
        cr_buildstep_run(name = "my-html-on-cloudrun",
                         image = "gcr.io/mark-edmondson-gde/html-on-cloudrun:$BUILD_ID",
                         concurrency = 80)
        ), 
    images = "gcr.io/mark-edmondson-gde/html-on-cloudrun:$BUILD_ID",
    )
```

5. Run a test build to check it works.

```r
b <- cr_build(build_rmd)
built <- cr_build_wait(b)
```

You should see a Cloud Run URL in the logs, like this one:
`https://my-html-on-cloudrun-ewjogewawq-ew.a.run.app/scheduled_rmarkdown.html`

6. Schedule the build using cron syntax

```r
schedule_me <- cr_build_schedule_http(built)
cr_schedule("rmd-on-cloudrun", "15 8 * * *", httpTarget = schedule_me)
#==CloudScheduleJob==
#name:  projects/project-name/locations/europe-west1/jobs/rmd-on-cloudrun 
#state:  ENABLED 
#httpTarget.uri:  https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v1/projects/project-name/builds 
#httpTarget.httpMethod:  POST 
#userUpdateTime:  2020-01-04T08:34:42Z 
#schedule:  15 8 * * * 
#timezone:  UTC 
```

## Polygot Cloud Builds - integrating R code with other languages

Since Docker containers can hold any language within them, they offer a universal UI to combine languages.  This offers opportunities to extend other languages with R features, and give other languages access to R code without needing to know R.

An example below uses:

* `gcloud` - [Google's Cloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) to access Google's key management store and download an authentication file
* `gago` - [A Go package for fast downloads of Google Analytics data](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/gago)
* `R` - R code to create an Rmd file that will hold interactive forecasts of the Google Analytics data via `cr_buildstep_r()`
* `nginx` - serve up the Rmd files rendered into HTML and hosted on Cloud Run via `cr_deploy_html()`


```{r, code=readLines("polygot.R"), eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

An example of the demo output is on this Cloud Run instance URL:
`https://polygot-demo-ewjogewawq-ew.a.run.app/polygot.html`

This constructed cloud build can also be used outside of R, by writing out the Cloud Build file via `cr_build_write()`

```r
# write out to cloudbuild.yaml for other languages
cr_build_write(polygot)
# 2019-12-28 19:15:50> Writing to cloudbuild.yaml
```

This can also be scheduled as described in Cloud Scheduler section on [scheduled cloud builds](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleCloudRunner/articles/cloudscheduler.html).

An example of that cloudbuild.yaml is on GitHub [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner/master/inst/polygot/cloudbuild.yaml).
