title: "GA imports into BigQuery via Polygot Cloud Builds - integrating R code with other languages"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
---

Since Docker containers can hold any language within them, they offer a universal UI to combine languages.  This offers opportunities to extend other languages with R features, and give other languages access to R code without needing to know R.

An example below uses:

* `gcloud` - [Google's Cloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) to access Google's key management store and download an authentication file, and pushes to BigQuery
* `gago` - [A Go package for fast downloads of Google Analytics data](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/gago)
* `R` - R code to create an Rmd file that will hold interactive forecasts of the Google Analytics data via `cr_buildstep_r()`
* `nginx` - serve up the Rmd files rendered into HTML and hosted on Cloud Run via `cr_deploy_html()`

And will perform downloading unsampled data from Google Analytics, creating a statistical report of the data and then uploading the raw data to BigQuery for further analysis.

```{r, code=readLines("polygot.R"), eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

An example of the demo output is on this Cloud Run instance URL:
`https://polygot-demo-ewjogewawq-ew.a.run.app/polygot.html`

It also uploads the data to a BigQuery table:

This constructed cloud build can also be used outside of R, by writing out the Cloud Build file via `cr_build_write()`

```r
# write out to cloudbuild.yaml for other languages
cr_build_write(polygot)
# 2019-12-28 19:15:50> Writing to cloudbuild.yaml
```

This can then be scheduled as described in Cloud Scheduler section on [scheduled cloud builds](https://code.markedmondson.me/googleCloudRunner/articles/cloudscheduler.html).

```r
schedule_me <- cr_build_schedule_http(built)
cr_schedule("polygot-example", "15 8 * * *", httpTarget = schedule_me)
```

An example of the cloudbuild.yaml is on GitHub [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner/master/inst/polygot/cloudbuild.yaml).
